# LETI algorithms and data structures

## Task
Implement an algorithm for finding the minimum skeleton based on the Kruskal (Kruskal) algorithm.

### Input data
Any text file containing the graph adjacency matrix in the form:{

A B C
0 3 1
3 0 2
1 2 0
}
where the first line contains a space-separated list of all edges, followed by the adjacency matrix. In the matrix, the value is 0 if there is no edge between the vertices, and a positive number that corresponds to the weight when the edge between the vertices exists.

### The result in the form of pairs sorted by name and total weight:{

A C
B C
3
}
Maximum input size: 50 vertices. Vertices can be specified by any text sequence without spaces. The edge weight is limited to the range from 1 to 1023 inclusive.

### What needs to be submitted
Program code with its own implementations of all proposed structures and algorithms described for the purposes of the course work.
Report based on the template https://etu.ru/assets/files/3004_3_ShABLON-kursovika.doc with a description of the selected sorting algorithms, graph traversal and CHM.
When defending your course work, you must answer any 3 questions about the program code or algorithms described in the report.
