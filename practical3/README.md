# Task

Trees. Implement:
1. A regular binary tree (not searching or balancing) with a depth-first traversal of this tree (the direction of the traversal is not important, the traversal is done through recursion).
2. Algorithm for parsing tree bracket notation. Example: (8 (9 (5)) (1)) - root 8, left son 9, right son 1, left son of node 9 - 5.
3. Implement an AVL tree (a complicated version - CN tree) with the implementation of algorithms for insertion, deletion, search, breadth-first traversal, depth-first traversal (all 3 types and use the iterative version). 

Showcase:
1. Reading a bracket notation (by reading from a file).
2. Step 1 either creates a binary tree or reports an error (wrong symbols, incorrect parentheses, not a binary tree at all, etc.).
3. Traverse the resulting tree and create an AVL (or CC) tree.
4. Demonstrate the output of all nodes in 4 ways: wide and 3 deep.
