# Task

List structure. Implement the following structure: doubly linked list, effect array and stack. 
A stack can be implemented either based on a list or separately. 
Use a stack to implement the marshalling yard algorithm. 

Allowed characters in the original expression: ```+, -, *, /, ^, sin, cos, (, ), 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9``` 
To simplify splitting the input string into tokens are allowed to be separated by each character space.
